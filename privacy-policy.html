            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Last updated: April 30, 2025</p>
            
            <h2 style="text-align:left;">1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Eye Sketchpad LLC ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Eye Exam Sketchpad application ("app") handles information.</p>
            <p>Eye Exam Sketchpad is designed with privacy at its core. The app functions as an observational tool for eye care professionals with a focus on maintaining complete privacy.</p>
            
            <h2 style="text-align:left;">2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
            
            <h3>2.1 Exam Data</h3>
            <p>The app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or patient information. All exam data is stored temporarily in your device's memory only and is cleared when you reset the app or force close it. No data from your exams is ever sent to our servers or any third parties.</p>
            
            <h3>2.2 Speech Recognition</h3>
            <p>The app uses on-device speech recognition provided by Apple's Speech framework. No audio recordings or transcripts are sent to our servers or any third-party servers. All speech processing occurs locally on your device.</p>
            
            <h3>2.3 User Corrections</h3>
            <p>The only data that persists between sessions are your speech recognition corrections, which contain no personal or patient information. These are stored locally on your device using Apple's UserDefaults system to improve dictation accuracy. These corrections never leave your device and are not transmitted anywhere.</p>
            
            <h3>2.4 Biometric Authentication</h3>
            <p>If you enable biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID), this security feature is handled entirely by Apple's system. The app does not store or access your biometric data; it merely receives a success/fail response from the operating system.</p>
            
            <h2 style="text-align:left;">3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            
            <h3>3.1 Temporary Storage</h3>
            <p>All exam data exists only in your device's temporary memory (RAM) and is never persisted to disk storage. The app is designed to function as a temporary tool, not as a system of record.</p>
            
            <h3>3.2 No Internet Connectivity</h3>
            <p>The app functions completely offline and does not use internet connectivity for any purpose. This means your data cannot be transmitted externally, intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
            
            <h3>3.3 Local Processing</h3>
            <p>All AI processing for organizing clinical observations occurs locally on your device using on-device machine learning models. No data is sent to external servers for processing.</p>
            
            <h2 style="text-align:left;">4. HIPAA Considerations</h2>
            <p>While the app is designed with HIPAA compliance in mind by not storing or transmitting Protected Health Information (PHI), users are responsible for implementing the app within their organization's HIPAA policies. The app functions as a temporary tool, not a system of record.</p>
            
            <h2 style="text-align:left;">5. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not share any user data with third parties because the app does not collect any data that could be shared.</p>
            
            <h2 style="text-align:left;">6. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our app is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18 and is designed specifically for healthcare professionals. We do not knowingly collect or solicit data from children.</p>
            
            <h2 style="text-align:left;">7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
            <p>Since the app does not collect personal data, there are no specific data access or deletion rights to exercise. If you wish to clear speech correction data, you can do this from within the app by using the "Manage Speech Corrections" feature and selecting "Clear All Corrections."</p>
            
            <h2 style="text-align:left;">8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last updated" date and will be available on our website and within the app.</p>
